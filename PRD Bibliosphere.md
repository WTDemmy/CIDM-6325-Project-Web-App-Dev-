 Product Requirements Document (PRD): Bibliosphere

 1. Document Information

- Software Name:  Bibliosphere Hybrid Bookstore Platform
- Author(s): Demi O
- Version: 1.0 (Draft)
 2. Overview

- Summary: A platform enabling independent bookstores to offer in-store digital sampling and purchasing of eBooks via a mobile app, enhancing customer experience and creating new revenue streams.
- Problem Statement: Independent bookstores are locked out of the digital market, and readers are forced to choose between physical and digital formats, leading to a fragmented experience.
- Goals & Objectives: Increase in-store engagement by 25%, boost sales conversion by 15%, enhance community value, generate new digital revenue streams.
- Non-Goals: AR/Meta glasses integration, POS system integration, advanced social features, custom e-reader development.

 3. Context & Background

- Business Context: Supports the digital transformation of independent bookstores, a sector experiencing resurgence (ABA, 2023) by leveraging their community advantage.
- Market/Customer Insights: A significant segment of readers are "hybrid," engaging with both physical and digital formats (Nielsen, 2022). This platform caters directly to this demographic.
- Competitive Landscape: Unlike retailers like Amazon, this solution is white-labeled for bookstores, turning their physical space into a competitive advantage against online giants.

 4. Scope

- In Scope: Mobile app (auth, QR scan, e-reader, geofencing, payment); Bookstore dashboard (inventory, analytics, QR management); Backend API (auth, sessions, metadata, payments); Pilot deployment.
- Out of Scope: AR Meta Glasses, POS integration, social features, custom e-reader, multi-store management.

 5. User Stories & Use Cases

- Primary Personas: The Reader, The Bookseller.
- User Stories:
  - As a Reader, I want to scan a book's QR code so I can read the eBook instantly in the store.
  - As a Reader, I want to purchase a digital copy of a book I'm sampling so I can continue reading it at home.
  - As a Bookseller, I want to generate QR codes for my inventory so I can enable the digital experience for customers.
  - As a Bookseller, I want to see which books are being sampled and purchased so I can make informed stocking decisions.
-Primary Use Case: The happy path of scan -> read -> purchase.

 6. Functional Requirements

- **FR-001 (Must):** User registration and login via email.
- **FR-002 (Must):** QR code scanner that interprets ISBNs.
- **FR-003 (Must):** System must restrict full eBook access to devices on the bookstore's designated WiFi network.
- **FR-004 (Must):** In-app purchase flow for digital books using Stripe.
- **FR-005 (Must):** Dashboard for bookstore staff to manage ISBNs and generate QR codes.

 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** eBooks must load in under 3 seconds in-store.
- **Security:** All data in transit (HTTPS); passwords hashed & salted; PCI compliance delegated to Stripe.
- **Accessibility:** App and dashboard must strive for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Reliability:** 99% uptime for core services during business hours.

 8. Dependencies

- **External:** OpenLibrary API (metadata), Stripe API (payments), Django framework.
- **Internal:** Bookstore's WiFi infrastructure.

 9. Risks & Assumptions

- **Risks:** WiFi reliability, low user adoption, publisher licensing issues.
- **Assumptions:** Bookstores have reliable WiFi; customers have smartphones; a pilot partner is available.

 10. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC for FR-002:** Given a valid QR code, the app must display the correct book metadata within 2 seconds.
- **AC for FR-003:** Given a user not on the store WiFi, the app must not grant eBook access.
- **AC for FR-004:** A user must be able to complete a purchase from the e-reader view in under 2 minutes.

 11. Success Metrics
*(See Section 5 of Project Pitch)*

 12. Rollout & Release Plan

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Core features for single-store pilot.
- **Phase 2 (V1.1):** Digital library management, enhanced analytics.
- **Release:** Beta testing with pilot partner, followed by iterative releases.

 13. Open Questions

 AI Disclosure Statement

The development of this document involved the use of a large language model (LLM) as a collaborative tool. The following is a transparent account of its use:

*   Prompts Used: The initial project concept was my own. I used an LLM with prompts similar to:
    *   "Draft a project pitch for a hybrid bookstore where customers use an app to scan QR codes on books to read the eBook for free while in the store, with the option to buy a digital or physical copy."
    *   "Simplify the MVA for this idea."
    *   " Draft a PRD based on this template for the bookstore project."
*   **Outputs Accepted:** I accepted the LLM's output for:
    *   Initial structuring of the document sections (Problem, Stakeholders, Scope).
    *   Generating a first draft of technical terminology and phrasing.
    *   Brainstorming potential risks and mitigations.
*   **Outputs Rejected & My Revisions:** I critically evaluated and heavily revised all LLM output. Key revisions I made include:
    *   Fact-Checking & Citations: I rejected all AI-generated citations and instead conducted my own research to find authoritative sources (e.g., the ABA and Nielsen reports) and properly cite them.
    *   Technical Accuracy: I redesigned the system architecture diagram to accurately reflect a realistic client-server model and replaced generic component names with specific technologies (e.g., Django, Stripe API).
    *   Scope Refinement: I refined the in-scope and out-of-scope items to ensure the MVA is realistically achievable, based on my understanding of the technical constraints.
    *   Original Thought: All strategic direction, success metrics, business value propositions, and the core innovative concept are my original work. The LLM was used solely as an assistant for drafting and expanding upon these original ideas.

**In summary, the LLM acted as a writing and brainstorming assistant, but the final document represents my own expertise, critical analysis, and original vision.**
